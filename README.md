## Lidar Module

#### Dependencies
- The lidar module will take a PWM signal as input and calculate the distance away (in metres) from the closest obstacle in the direction the lidar is pointing. The distance returned has volatile unsigned int data type.
- The lidar module can be used in conjunction with the speaker module to make warning sounds when an obstacle is very close.
- The lidar module can be used in conjunction with the serialisation module to continuously print the value of the currently measured distance in a terminal like PuTTY. 

#### Usability
- First, the user must use 'Init_lidar' so that the variables, interrupts and ports used by the lidar module are initialised and configured as intended
